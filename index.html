      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello and Welcome to my personal page! My name is Raquel Scofield, and I am currently the Social Media Manager for a tools company. I’m excited to be attending UCF’s coding bootcamp and look forward to learning, creating, and collaborating!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Rockledge, FL, I have lived all over the Space Coast while my family worked for the space program and it was a big part of my life growing up.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy spending time with my kids, family, and friends. I’m also very into fitness, specifically nutrition and strength training.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be to create or assist in the creation of software that has a measurable positive impact on other people. With that said, I am excited to learn more about technologies and figure out where in the industry I’d like to be. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I  currently reside in New Smyrna Beach, FL.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In Elementary School I took a strong interest in computers and while looking at other peoples websites, decided I wanted to make my own about my favorite subject at the time: Hamsters! Since growing up, I have followed the industry and am continually amazed by the people, products, and services within it. I have enjoyed all of my time spent coding, researching, and debugging thus far, and am ready to learn more and become a part of the industry. </p>
